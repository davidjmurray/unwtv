# unwtv
Time to move away from all things wtv (MS-Windows Record TV Show).

As Microsoft has not offered the WMC (Windows Media Center) component of MS-Windows beyond MS-Windows 8, you may be trapped or stuck with MS-Windows 7 to record, maintain, and view your video library.

This is a collection of scripts to help with the migration from all things wtv to more open options.

Cheers and good luck.
